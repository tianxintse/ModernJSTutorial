    <!-- The change event triggers when the element has finished changing.

    For text inputs that means that the event occurs when it looses focus.

    For instance, while we are typing in the text field below – there’s no event. But when we move the focus somewhere
    else, for instance, click on a button – there will be a change event: -->

    <input type="text" onchange="alert(this.value)">
    <input type="button" value="Button">
