    The following methods allow to set date/time components:

    - setFullYear(year [, month, date])
    - setMonth(month [, date])
    - setDate(date)
    - setHours(hour [, min, sec, ms])
    - setMinutes(min [, sec, ms])
    - setSeconds(sec [, ms])
    - setMilliseconds(ms)
    - setTime(milliseconds) (sets the whole date by milliseconds since 01.01.1970 UTC)

    Every one of them except setTime() has a UTC-variant, for instance: setUTCHours().

    As we can see, some methods can set multiple components at once,
    for example setHours. The components that are not mentioned are not modified.

    today.setHours(0);
    alert(today);

    today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
    alert(today);
